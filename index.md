### Research
My research interest lies in Operations Management and Game Theory.

I am very fortunate to learn how to do research from Professor [Qiyuan Deng](https://myweb.cuhk.edu.cn/dengqiyuan), Professor [Chenglong Zhang](https://myweb.cuhk.edu.cn/zhangchenglong) and Professor [Pin Gao](https://myweb.cuhk.edu.cn/gaopin). They teach me a lot, more than expertise. They also give me many opportunities. I am very grateful to them.
